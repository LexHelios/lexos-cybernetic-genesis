# HTTPS Setup Complete

HTTPS has been configured for your server with the following changes:

## What was done:

1. **SSL Certificates Created**: Self-signed certificates generated in the `ssl/` directory
   - Certificate: `ssl/fullchain.pem`
   - Private Key: `ssl/privkey.pem`
   - Valid for 365 days

2. **NGINX Configuration Updated**: The `nginx.conf` file now includes:
   - HTTPS server block listening on port 443
   - SSL/TLS configuration with modern security settings
   - HTTP/2 support enabled
   - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) header
   - All existing routes configured for HTTPS

3. **Docker Compose Ready**: The existing `docker-compose.yml` already mounts:
   - SSL certificates directory: `./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl`
   - NGINX config: `./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
   - Ports 80 and 443 exposed

## To Start the Server with HTTPS:

```bash
# If services are already running, restart them:
docker-compose restart nginx

# Or start all services:
docker-compose up -d
```

## Access the Server:

- HTTP: http://localhost (port 80)
- HTTPS: https://localhost (port 443)

**Note**: Since this uses a self-signed certificate, browsers will show a security warning. You can:
1. Accept the security exception in your browser
2. Or replace with a Let's Encrypt certificate for production use

## For Production (Let's Encrypt):

To get a proper SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt:

```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot

# Stop nginx temporarily
docker-compose stop nginx

# Get certificate (replace your-domain.com with your actual domain)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Copy certificates to ssl directory
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem ./ssl/
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem ./ssl/

# Start nginx again
docker-compose start nginx
```

## Security Notes:

- The current configuration uses TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only
- Strong cipher suites are configured
- HSTS is enabled to force HTTPS connections
- The server maintains its "unrestricted mode" settings as configured
